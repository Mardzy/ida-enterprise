Snowball the hamster is Brain's former friend who was also made intelligent by gene splicing and has a similar desire

## Why?

During the development we work with different layers. There is the data layer, the UI layer, and there is
a third one; something which is hard to grasp. This layer is the one which combines the UI elements to 
more complex components.

This is the place where we put our application containers and the related components.

## Structuring

Create independent modules and define a clear interface.
